This Repository stroes the recent python projects I am working on.
 
 Project 1 : Get details of related movies and books for a given name.
 
 Project 2: Collect the tweets for the top 10 banks using tweepy, calculate the sentiment score using textblob and project in a matplotlib horizontal bar chart.
 
 Project 3: Game - Wheel of Fortune (inspired by Coursera 'Python OOPs concepts' assignment)
